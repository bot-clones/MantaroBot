      "pick": "A normal pickaxe you bought on the local market. Seems sturdy enough to mine some stuff.",
      "diamond_pick": "A diamond pick is definitely stronger than the market-bought iron picks I could get on the market, that's for sure!",
      "comet_pick": "You found some Comet Fragments and realized you could make a Comet Gem out of them.\nWhat did they do? Were they special?\nYou seemed eager to try it out after being impressed by its glow, so here we are, in your first step towards getting stronger picks.",
      "star_pick": "Maybe it was the glow, maybe it was the fact they came from a star far away in the galaxy, but it seemed to make for quite a sturdy pick with special properties.\nWeird... it seems to attract more gems. Is it the effect of the material, or is it my skill getting better?",
      "moon_pick": "The moon-like substance mesmerized you.\nWas it the fact it glowed like a full moon, or was it the fact it seemed to float on its own?\nRegardless, you tried to fuse this with your current pick, and the result was quite satisfactory.\nSeems to be a good balance between light and dark, and somehow I mine some gems with it.\nIs this really a fragment from a far away moon?",
      "sparkle_pick": "Something made you look up into the caverns, and you found a sparkly gem on top. Looking up, some fell onto your pick, and it made the pick shine enough to light up the entire cavern.\nQuickly, you grab some of the sparkly fragments and get a casting station.\nThe pick glows bright like the sun... and it seems pretty tough too... how did it fuse so well with iron?",
      "hellfire_pick": "Reactions between all the elements can be a weird and dangerous process.\nRegardless of what your friends told you, you decided to research this topic, and came up with an object brighter than anything you've ever seen...\nIt seems to be a mix of all the other elements, but it seems quite reactive... it's also quite tough, not much seems to be able to break it...\nHave I done good for this world, or have I brought the unknown to life?",
      "axe": "A normal axe you bought on the local market. Good enough to chop some trees down.",
      "comet_axe": "After testing the Comet Fragments on your pick, you also realized you could use them on your axe. It made it stronger, and shinier. All you could wish for.",
      "star_axe": "A bright glow from a star far away, but in your hands.\nLooks like the tree-chopping can continue with this new, shiny axe. You seemed weirded out at first: how can this help me mine more wood?\nWell, you soon realized why...",
      "sparkle_axe": "A touch of sparkle here, a touch of sparkle there!\nThe axe glows bright like the sun... and it seems pretty tough too... how did it fuse so well with iron?",
      "moon_axe": "Looking at this axe, you look mesmerized by moon-like glow it emits.\nWas it the fact it glowed like a full moon, or was it the fact it seemed to float on its own?\nMesmerized, you cast this substance into your axe and... boom!\nThe results look good. It seems to chop trees faster, too. Why is it so sharp? Is this really a fragment from a far away moon?",
      "hellfire_axe": "Reactions between all the elements can be a weird and dangerous process.\nYou mastered the elements already, and fusing it with your axe now seemed trivial. Maybe it was the glow, maybe it was the fire, but you had to do it.\nIt works wonders. Nothing can compare. But you're still left wondering whether you really did the right thing.",
      "rod": "A rod you bought at your local fishing market. Looks sturdy.",
      "comet_rod": "After testing the Comet Fragments on your axe, you also realized you could use them on your rod. It made the thread stronger, and it seemed to attract more fish to it. All you could wish for.",
      "star_rod": "The mesmerizing and shiny glow of this fragment could not be overlooked. You fused it together with the thread of your rod, and the fish came flowing through it! Seems like a bait isn't necessary all the time, but it's still useful.",
      "moon_rod": "You're still impressed by the way this gem floats on it's own. Regardless, you fuse it with the thread of your rod as best as you can. It seems to be a little stronger than a Star Fragment infused rod, but not by much.\nEitherway, you enjoy the glow of it like it's the first day you've ever seen it.",
      "sparkle_rod": "A touch of sparkle here, a touch of sparkle there!\nYou pulverized the Sparkle Fragments and coated the thread of your fishing rod with it.\nYou seem confused. How can this attract fish?\nThe world has many mysteries, and this is one of them. Maybe it can help you get more credits. Maybe it can bring you satisfaction.\nThe glow it leaves on the sea is amazing, and you stare at it for hours on end. Maybe you did do the right thing after all.",
      "hellfire_rod": "Reactions between all the elements can be a weird and dangerous process.\nYou mastered the elements already, and fusing it with your fishing rod thread now seemed trivial. Maybe it was the glow, maybe it was the fire, but you had to do it.\nIt works wonders. Fish come in shoals to you. Nothing can compare. But you're still left wondering whether you really did the right thing.",
      "wrench": "A run of the mill wrench you can buy from the market. Useful for repairing items.",
      "comet_wrench": "A Wrench infused with pieces of Comet Gems. Somehow it feels way sturdier.",
      "sparkle_wrench": "A Wrench infused with pieces of Sparkle Fragments. Somehow it feels a lot sturdier."
