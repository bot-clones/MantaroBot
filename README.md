# Using the Official Mantaro Bot

**Just one [click](https://add.mantaro.site) and you can add Mantaro to your own server and enjoy its full feature set!**

You can see more information about the bot itself by reading the summary on [here](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/FEATURES.md). This is the file we use to publish our bots on bot lists, too. You're welcome to use it as a guide for your own. Our [webpage](https://mantaro.site) is hosted in [Github Pages](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io) and outlines most features of the bot, alongside some useful links.

# Building your own Mantaro

## âš  **Read before attempting**
The owners of Mantaro do not recommend compiling Mantaro as it is not documented, and most builds here will be extremely unstable and (probably) untested, probably including unfinished features. There's no *stable* branch, all the features are immediately added to upstream.\
You will however sometimes see a legacy branch, a branch we create before publishing larger update containing working code, it is highly recommended basing your building process from the legacy branch, as the master branch will very likely contain broken and non-working code, at least in a case where a legacy branch exist.

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in selfhosting or building the bot by yourself.**
The reason for this is not only that the builds in here can be highly unstable, but also that there are very few people (two) who could actually help with questions regarding this, most of which are busy and not available to answer said questions. Most of the build process is pretty straightforward and outlined below, though.

## Building the Bot

### Prerequisite:

You will need the following to utilize all of Mantaro's features when building your own instance (items marked with a star are optional):
* RethinkDB, at least version 2.4
* Java Development Kit, version 15 (not lower!)
* Redis, at least version 6
* Wolke's Weeb API (For most of the action commands)*

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in obtaining any of the above.**

<sub>Note: The bot does not necessarily need the Weeb API key to function, but some functionality might be limited by the lack of them (no action commands). Due to the closed nature of that API, we encourage you to submit a patch that would allow custom images to be used on self-hosted instances if you'd like (ex. by pushing your own -local- API server), but keep them in line with the rest of the code.</sub> 

### Editing Code:
Mantaro isn't a modular bot (sadly), but removing features is fairly easy. You can just remove the respective command or the Module file on the commands directory and everything *should* still work. The exception are some Modules that are required by other Modules.
Make sure you pay close attention to the [license](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/LICENSE) as you will be required to disclose your source as well as state any changes made.

### Steps for building:
<sub>Please do note that you will not receive any help whatsoever while trying to make your own Mantaro build (see above).</sub>

1.  Make sure you have the prerequisites installed and running.
2.  Clone this repository (you can also fork this repo and clone your fork). 
3.  Open a terminal (cmd.exe or any linux terminal) in the folder where you cloned this on.
4.  Run `gradlew shadowJar`
5.  Grab the jar from `build/libs`
6.  Install `rethinkdb` and `redis`
7.  On rethinkdb, create the `mantaro` database with the following tables: `mantaro, players, marriages, playerstats, users, guilds, keys, commands, seasonalplayers`
8.  Run it, wait a little for the bot to generate a file called `config.json`
9.  Prepare yourself to start filling in some config values. You don't need to fill all values, though. The token and the user id are necessary to start up, you wanna set the owner IDs aswell to be able to use owner commands. Values you *need* to fill: `token clientId`, values you *need* to change: `"bucketFactor" : 1 "isSelfHost" : true`.
9.  In config.json, you might want set the value needApi to false, or clone and run [the API](https://github.com/Kodehawa/mantaro-api))

### Extra runtime options:
This are java arguments that Mantaro parses outside of config.json at startup and that can be dynamically adjusted using a script, a systemd service or similar:
*   `-Dmantaro.node-number=x` - Specify the number of this node (important if you use more than once instance)
*   `-Dmantaro.shard-count=x` - Specify the amount of shards Mantaro will be starting up. (for all nodes, see below for subsets)
*   `-Dmantaro.from-shard=x` - Start Shard Manager from shard X. (inclusive)
*   `-Dmantaro.to-shard=y`- Start Shard Manager up to shard Y. (exclusive)
*   `-Dmantaro.verbose` - Log all the things.
*   `-Dmantaro.verbose_shard_logs` - Show all shard status changes.
*   `-Dmantaro.debug` - Start Mantaro with two shards and some extra logging, regardless of the settings above.
*   `-Dmantaro.debug_logs` - Use debug logs.
*   `-Dmantaro.trace_logs` - Spam your logs.
*   `-Dmantaro.log_db_access` - Log all db access. (spams your logs aswell)
*   `-Dmantaro.disable-non-allocating-buffer` - Disable LP's non-allocating buffer.

The above options can also be used as environment variables by removing `-D`, and replacing `.` with `_`, for example, `-Dmantaro.node-number=x` becomes environment variable `MANTARO_NODE_NUMBER=x`
